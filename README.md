# leaflet-challenge
The main file is logic.js. Here we load D3 .json and get  the response fed into the fucntion that created the tiles layer, and extracts the long, lat and depth. The pop up windows for each locatiomn
were added that would report the detaild of the quake. In additoin we added depth to track via color of the bubble while radius tracks the magnitude of quake.

NOTE we decided to keep the earthquakes close to surface as more impact full to ones deep ones. Hence the color changes from Red (zero depth) to Green (large depth)
